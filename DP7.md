1. ##### **Written protocol**

   - **Instructions for setting and setting up the testing environment**

     This prototype is implemented for web environment, especially Chrome.
     You can access to the prototype through the URL.

     - Prototype URL: https://jas03006.github.io/525
     - Recommended web browser: Chrome
     - Data Setting
       - Project: no project at default.

       - Memory: refer data in the following image

         ![](.\1.png)

       - Account: login with [ID: 'testuser1', password: '1234'] or just click login button in homepage with default setting. 

   - **Introduction and informed consent**

     Our project is to redesign ‘writing Cover-Letter experience’. You might have been confused with what to write in the Cover-Letter. With our prototype, you can record your memory in detail and you can easily organize them.

     We will collect your demographic information (Age, occupation, your personal statement writing experience) and record computer screen while user testing. Also, there might be some note will be taken by observer too. All the information and result will be used only for our Human Computer Interaction class project. If you don't want to share your demographic information, we will not collect it.

   - **Tutorial or training**

     Actually our home page, which is our start page contains tutorials, so user can freely come back to the home page to see the tutorial. So we didn't prepared for additional tutorial and training.

   - **Task list & instruction**

     - Tasks

       1. Record your ‘**Impressive experience**’ to use it as a source of your paper.

       2. **Organize outline** of your personal statement with your uploaded memory.

       3. **Write a draft** of your personal statement with the outline.

          

       In task 1, we slightly changed our 'internship experience' to 'impressive experience' to make user to test our prototype with 'user's experience', which is not given by us.

     - Instructions

       Before we start, let's make a few assumption. Suppose you are applying for a job at 'Samsung Electronics', and suppose several experience are already recorded. 3 tasks will be given and you will go through task 1 to task 3 which can help you easily write the Cover-Letter for 'Samsung Electronics'. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Let's begin.

   - **Recording strategy**

     Screen recording and note taking. We will also collect demographic information as we mentioned in 'informed consent' part to make our target user clear.

     Jeonghun Moon will be facilitator and others will be observers.

   - **Questionnaires, Interview questions**

     1. Are there any functions that were difficult to understand at once?
     2. Was there any differences comparing with your original way to writing personal statement? 
     3. If you have any other ideas, please feel free to share.

     

     Plus if there is any unexpected action, we will ask additional question about the action.  

   - **Debrief prompt**

     This is the end of our session, and thank you so much for your participation. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It will be a big pleasure for us to run user test with you and it will be great help in our project. Thank you!

2. ##### **Session observations**

   1. Participants: Who are they? How did you recruit them? Why are they representative target users? Add brief demographic, context information about each participant that is relevant to your interface.
   2. Use at least one photo or sketch for each participant and provide a summary description of each session (e.g., What was unique about this participant? Main takeaway from this participant's session?).

3. ##### **Usability lessons**

   1. List at least 10 usability problems you discovered. Organize them by high-level task or theme, not by each participant or time. But mention which participant ran into the problem by referring to them as P1, P2, ... (e.g., search results did not show the price information (P1, P3)). For each problem, indicate how critical the problem is: high, medium, and low. Finally, show how you plan to address each of the problems.
   2. High-level reflections: What did you overall learn from the user testing experience? What would you do differently for better results and insights?

4. ##### **Studio Reflections**

   1. Summarize the feedback from the studio session, and mention how you addressed it or will address it later in the process.

5. ##### **Plan for iteration**

   1. You'll have an additional week to finalize your overall design process. Discuss in your team how to use this time most effectively, and make a few concrete goals. Justify your goals.
